This Python code is designed for analyzing CVs (resumes) by extracting, processing, and visualizing key information such as skills, education, experience, and contact details. It combines natural language processing (NLP) techniques, file handling, and data visualization to generate insights from the content of a CV. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the main parts:

File Reading (read_file):
This function reads either a .txt or .pdf file and extracts its content. It supports two file types and processes PDF pages with PyPDF2 to extract text.

Processing CV (process_cv):

File Content Cleaning: The CV content is cleaned by replacing special characters and Romanian month names with English equivalents.
Skill Classification: Predefined skill sets for data science, front-end, back-end, testing, data engineering, and soft skills are used to match the CV content. It tokenizes the text, removes stopwords, lemmatizes (reduces words to their base form), and then categorizes the skills found.
Bar Chart Visualization: A horizontal bar chart shows the number of matched skills in each category, which is encoded in base64 to be displayed as an image.
Email Extraction:
A regular expression pattern is used to find an email address in the CV.

Education Extraction:
The code searches for education-related sections and extracts relevant degrees (Doctorate, Masters, Bachelor, etc.). It ranks and outputs the highest level of education found.

Experience Extraction:
Using regex, the code detects job titles and employment periods. It calculates the duration of each job and totals the number of years of experience. It also visualizes this data using a pie chart representing the time spent at each job.

Visualizations:
The code creates two main visualizations:

Skills Bar Chart: Displays the count of matched skills for each category.
Job Experience Pie Chart: Visualizes the proportion of time spent in various jobs.
Insights Output:
The final output is a dictionary that contains:

The extracted email
The highest degree of education
A categorized list of skills found
Total years of job experience
Average duration of jobs
Encoded images of the skills bar chart and job experience pie chart
This code is useful for automating CV analysis, extracting meaningful data, and presenting it in a visually understandable form.

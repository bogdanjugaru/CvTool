Despre mine I am a skilled Front-End developer with over 3 years
of experience in crafting responsive and dynamic web
applications. My expertise lies in harnessing the power of
JavaScript to bring web projects to life, and I'm proficient in using
cutting-edge frameworks like React and jQuery, as well as
Vanilla Javascript to deliver outstanding user experiences.
In addition to my Front-End skills, I have also ventured into Fullstack development, showcasing my passion for creating digital
solutions. I've engineered Back-End applications using Node.js
and Express.js along with PHP as well as database management
with MySQL and MongoDB. This complements my Front-End
proficiency, enabling me to manage entire projects.
I also created WebView apps for Google Play using Android
Studio, further demonstrating my versatility in web and mobile
application development.
With a proven track record of successful projects and a
dedication to staying at the forefront of web development
trends, I'm excited to bring my expertise to your team. Let's
work together to turn your web development goals into stunning,
functional realities.
